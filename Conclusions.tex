\chapter{Conclusions}
The present thesis covers developments and results achieved in three separate projects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the measurement of the VBF Higgs cross section in the $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4l$ decay channel using ANNs;
	\item the author's contributions during his participation in the CMS L1TT AM+FPGA project leaded by Fermilab;
	\item the developments and results achieved by a technique called Fast Matrix Element.
\end{itemize}

The measurement of the VBF Higgs cross section comprehends the studies developed by the author in the majority of his PhD course time. In order to make clear the contributions of this work, the conclusions about it are highlighted:
\begin{itemize}
		\item {\color{blue}ANN approach successfully implemented for an isolated VBF $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4l$ XS measurement};
		\item {\color{blue}Reliable} procedure implemented for {\color{blue}systematic uncertainties};
		\item {\color{blue}Results} provided from the combination of our {\color{blue}best ANN configurations}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\justifying
			\item best fit for signal strength: {\color{blue}$\mu_{qqH}^{Exp} = 1.00_{-0.70}^{+1.08}$} and {\color{blue}$\mu_{qqH}^{Obs} = 1.28_{-0.84}^{+1.24}$};
			\item 95$\%$CL upper limits on $\mu_{qqH}$: {\color{blue}$\mu_{qqH}^{Exp} < 1.66$} and {\color{blue}$\mu_{qqH}^{Obs} < 3.79$};
			\item significances: {\color{blue}$\sigma_{qqH}^{Exp} = 1.8$} and {\color{blue}$\sigma_{qqH}^{Obs} = 1.9$};
		\end{itemize}
		\item {\color{blue}Projections} provided for future luminosity scenarios at the LHC:
		\begin{itemize}
			\justifying
			\item Expected to improve signal strength precision up to {\color{blue}$\sim$87$\%$} at the end of RunII;
			\item Significance evolution:\\

				\hline
				Luminosity (fb$^{-1}$) & 35.9 & 150.0 & 300.0 & 359.0 & 1077.0 & 1795.0 & 3000.0\\
				\hline
				Factor                 & 1.00 & 4.18  & 8.36  & 10.00 & 30.00  & 50.00  & 83.57\\

				Expected significance  & 1.8  & 3.4   & 4.7   & 5.1   & 8.6    & 10.9   & 14.0\\

		\end{itemize}
		\item Analysis documentation is ready and released: {\color{blue}AN-18-120};
		\item {\color{blue}No issues} raised last meeting with HZZ subgroup (December 7$^{th}$, 2018) at CERN (green light for a thesis endorsement);
