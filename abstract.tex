A isolated measurement of the Higgs boson production cross section in the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) production mode is performed in the $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4l (l=e,~\mu)$ channel. The study is performed using data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ from pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, which has been collected by the CMS experiment during 2016 at the LHC. A multivariate analysis is performed through the usage of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Statistical shape analysis of ANNs developed for two orthogonal jet-based categories is done by combining the discriminants distribution from each category. The Higgs VBF signal strength modifier is measured to be $\mu_{qqH} = 1.28^{+1.24}_{-0.84}$ for a expected Higgs boson of $m_{H} = 125$GeV. This result is compatible with the SM expectation. The observed significance of the present analysis is $\sigma_{qqH}^{obs} = 1.9$, while the expected one is $\sigma_{qqH}^{exp} = 1.8$. The observed and expected 95$\%$CL limits are estimated as $\mu_{qqH}^{obs} < 3.79$ and $\mu_{qqH}^{obs} < 1.66$, respectively. A projection for future luminosities is also presented and it is expected that the present analysis will have enough significance for the VBF Higgs production evidence (3.4$\sigma$) at 150fb$^{-1}$ and the observance (5.1$\sigma$) at 359fb$^{-1}$.
